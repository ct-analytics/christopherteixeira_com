Christopher Teixeira is a Department Chief Engineer in the Public Health Systems Innovation and Transformation Department within the CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (Health) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). Heâ€™s responsible for providing his expertise in statistics, applied probability, modeling and simulation, and operations research to a variety of challenges that the federal government faces. In particular, he works directly with multiple federal agencies to identify potential solutions to the challenges they face and how best to use data to drive decisions they need to make. This includes helping them distinguish between the advantages and differences of varying analytical techniques. This breadth of knowledge and applications has led Chris towards becoming an expert at shaping efforts with sponsors including writing the contract language, cost proposals, and technical proposals across multiple efforts over the years. In addition, as Chief Engineer, Chris provides oversight to an average of 10 projects a year, ensuring sounds technical approaches and designing risk mitigation strategies.

Chris served in a variety of roles over the course of his career at MITRE. He first joined as an individual contributor serving several sponsors by applying his background in Applied Statistics and Operations Research. This includes supporting multiple federally funded research and development centers across a variety of projects, such as supporting the Department of Energy in understanding how to safely and effectively treat nuclear waste and helping the Veterans Benefits Administration use sophisticated modeling techniques to better serve veterans. Recently, Christopher led a project that used a variety of advanced analytical techniques to define and identify opioid prescribing behaviors. In this role, he led a team of 20 data scientists and presented this material in public meetings to a group of Chief Medical Officers, State Commissioners, public health experts, and data scientists. He earned an M.S. in operations research from George Mason University and a B.S. in mathematics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
