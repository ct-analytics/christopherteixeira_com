I had the pleasure of organizing an accelerator program that supported companies understanding what it takes to work with the federal government. Over the course of 3 cohorts, 15 companies learned about federal acquisition strategies, cyber security requirements, and other technology considerations that the federal government requires to operate.

- **Spearheaded the logistical planning and execution of three collaborative events** between Stadia Ventures portfolio companies and MITRE, including venue coordination, agenda development, and participant communication, resulting in successful technology showcases for U.S. government agencies.
- **Led cross-functional efforts** to coordinate the participation of startup founders, MITRE mentors, and government representatives, ensuring seamless engagement and productive interactions during accelerator program sessions and demo days.
- **Managed all aspects of the "demo day" pitch events** for three cohorts of sports and esports technology companies, including presentation coaching, technical setup, and liaison with government agency attendees, facilitating opportunities for potential partnerships and technology transfer.
- **Developed and maintained comprehensive project plans** for each event, tracking key milestones, managing budgets, and proactively addressing potential challenges to ensure on-time and successful delivery.
- **Facilitated communication and collaboration** between Stadia Ventures, MITRE, and participating companies, fostering a productive environment for innovation discovery and the exploration of technology applications for national challenges across three separate cohorts.
- **Recruited and coordinated 80+ MITRE experts** across data privacy, cyber security, data science, and related fields to provide expert guidance during three collaborative events.
