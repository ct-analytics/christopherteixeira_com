I led an interdisciplinary team to help the IRS establish consistent and efficient approaches to various aspects of governance and stratgic direction for data and AI related efforts.  

- **Project Leadership:** Manage a diverse team of 15+ staff, creating tasking, reporting to sponsor leadership, identifying and executing project risk management strategies, and managing the finances. 
- **Strategic Guidance:** Organized several working sessions to engage staff and draft a strategy to use, develop, and ensure trust in AI and Machine Learning applications across the agency. 
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engage with senior leaders across the agency to establish a data strategy that will guide IRS to continue to be a data-driven organization. 
- **Trusted Advisor:** Support the growth of a new division within the agency by identifying potential functions, providing recommendations on building a brand, and establishing good reporting practices.
