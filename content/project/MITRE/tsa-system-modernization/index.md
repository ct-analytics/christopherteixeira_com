Designed a system architecture to host a web interface and Postgres database that enables TSA the ability to review reports, perform sensitivities analyses, and establish a governance process for sharing information. Prototyped a web interface and back end data storage with Python using Pandas and Flask. Outlined a data governance process to accommodate regular data refreshes, data quality checks, and other data shifts that could influence down stream calculations.
